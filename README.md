# K-Means
The project aims to perform cluster analysis on the Iris dataset using the K-Means clustering algorithm. The Iris dataset consists of measurements of four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) for three different species of iris flowers (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica).
